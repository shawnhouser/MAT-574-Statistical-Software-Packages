What is a Database Management System
	A tool that provides a layer of abstraction
	over the data that you interact with.

Without a Database
	You have to interact with a bunch of files
		Imagine doing analysis on MainStreet
		There will be a bunch of different data types
		There could be many csv's, json, xml, or worse
	You may have to deal with custom datatypes
		USM may have a custom format that you need
		to extract data from.

A database will solve these issues
Sqlite3 is a specific database manager (it manages the data)

Why Sqlite3
	It saves all of the data in one file
	You interact with this data using SQL
	It can be easier to ask for data in SQL
		than it would be to write code in R
	It has been tried and tested
	Universal, works on nearly anything
	Used everywhere
		Web browsers, cars, planes
	Databases it produces are a single file that
		can be transfered without fear of different
		computers doing nasty things to the data
		
What does a database look like?
	Collection of tables
	Each table is like its own csv file
	Relations between tables
		Different tables can share values

Example Database
	words.csv
	---->
	word_string | word_id
	------------|--------
	 Strawberry |    1
	 Apple      |    2
	 ...        |  ...
	 Saturday   | 93,784

	counts.csv
	---->
	 word_id | word_count
	 --------|-----------
	     1   |  3992
	     2   |    42
	 93,784  |   112

Installing sqlite3
	install.packages("RSQLite")
	This should be all you need.
	Usure if this will install sqlite3 itself,
	or only allow connection if it is already installed
